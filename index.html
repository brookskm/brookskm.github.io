        <p> Since being introduced to Computer Science Principles in Junior year of high school, I became fascinated
            with software and technology, which has yet to waver throughout the years. I am a current student at
            Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology studying software engineering, and will be set to graduate in 2024. My
            hope is to have a positive impact on the software development community, and I am currently seeking
            positions in the field. I am a member of the NSBE Rose-Hulman charter, proficient with Linux operating
            systems, and enjoy repairing video game and computer peripherals in my spare time.</p>

        <p>On this website you can find my previous projects involving software development and communication, my most
            recent resume, and professional contact information. Thank you for visiting my website!</p>
